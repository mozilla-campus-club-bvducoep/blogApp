## Contributors Guidelines to Mozilla campus club bvdu open-source repo

# Getting Started

## Learn Git and Github

All our development is done using Git and Github. If you're not too familiar with Git and Github, start by reviewing this guide. https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

## Setup
Forking a Repository

To contribute to python-scripts you will need to fork the python-scripts repository. Then you can work risk-free on your fork.

You will just need to fork once. After that you can call git fetch upstream and git pull 'branch-name' before you do your local changes to get the remote changes and be up-to-date.

## Contributing

Beginner Issues

If you are new to the project and want to get into the code, we recommend picking an issue with the label "good first issue". These issues should only require general programming knowledge and little to none insights into the project.
Issue Allocation

Each issue someone is currently working on should have an assignee. If you want to contribute to an issue someone else is already working on please make sure to get in contact with that person via slack or github and organize yourself.

If you want to work on an open issue, please post a comment telling that you will work on that issue, we will assign you as the assignee then.

Caution: We try our best to keep the assignee up-to-date, but as we are all humans with our own schedule delays are possible, so make sure to check the comments once before you start working on an issue even when no one is assigned to it.
